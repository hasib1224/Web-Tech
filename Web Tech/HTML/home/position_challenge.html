        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is the code used to structure a web page and its content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to surround or wrap different content parts to make it appear a certain way or act.</p>
        <h3>What are the Uses of HTML?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                HTML is excessively used for creating pages shown on the world wide web. Every page consists of a set of HTML tags, including a hyperlink used to connect to other pages. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML, and its basics are tag and document, object models. HTML tags are inserted before and after or phrases to locate their format on the page.
            </li>

            <li>
                This navigation is possible by exploiting the concept of hypertext. It is a text which refers to other web pages or text, and when users click on it, they will navigate to referenced text or page.

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>JS</h2>
        <img id="pic" src="js.png" height="250px" width="250px" >
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
